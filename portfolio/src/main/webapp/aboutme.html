        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am Edem (/ɛd-ɛm/) Koshi Nuviadenu. I am currently a 3rd year Computer Engineering
          student in McGill University, Canada but my home country is Ghana. I am passionate about
          technology and love learning new skills, especially if it means I get to build impactful
          products. I like to see the opportunity in every challenge because I am a strong believer
          in focusing on goals and not obstacles.
        </p>
        <p>
          My passion for tech really came to light from my love and desire to understand and build
          circuit boards. My interest in software dev grew from my initial implementation of art
          designs using turtle command in python. I never really understood the complexity of what 
          I did until my journey to Canada to study Electrical Engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
          I began my university studies at McGill University in 2017. After taking my first
          software development class in both Java and C, I was immediately hooked and enjoyed
          the thrill and opportunity of seeing code that I implemented
          actually working.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, my passion for tech has become more of how I can harness and shape my skills
          in order to be able to take a product from idea to completion. My goal is to be able
          to contribute to my society through building impactful/meaningful products that
          positively impact my community.
