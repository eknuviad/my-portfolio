    <h1> AWFE (A-Walk-For-Education)</h1>
    <p>
      One of my proudest moments has been organizing the walk for education in both 2018
      and 2019 as the Academic Excellence Chair of NSBE McGill. This walk is part of an
      international effort by NSBE to reach out to visible minority students who are
      passionate about education and have shown keen interest in the STEM field.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over 20 volunteers walk with the kids within the Montreal area. During the walk,
      the volunteers and community centers get an opportunity to present and explain
      educational services available for the students. The walk culminates at Les Scientifines
      where McGill clubs and design teams exhibit their projects alongside those of the
      different student groups from the community centres.
    </p>
    <p>
      The students all get an opportunity to solve simple hands-on challenges and for both
      years 2018 and 2019 I was able to introduce the students to Scratch programming
      software which they always love. Through this event the team and I have been
      able to speak to and encourage the students to strive for excellence in school.
