      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <!-- insert pictures of Ghana, McGill, circuit board, software dev -->
      <p>I am Edem (/ɛd-ɛm/) Koshi Nuviadenu. I am currently a 3rd year Computer Engineering 
        student in McGill University,Canada but my home country is Ghana. I am passionate about 
        technology and love learning new skills,especially if it means I get to build impactful 
        products. I like to see the opportunity in every challenge because I am a strong believer 
        in focusing on goals and not obstacles.
      </p>
      <p>
        My passion for tech really came to light from my love and desire to understand and build 
        circuit boards. My interest in software dev grew from my initial implementation of art
        designs using turtle command in python prior to me starting university but I never really 
        understood the complexity of what I did until my journey to 
        Canada to study Electrical Engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        I began my university studies at McGill University in 2017 and after taking my first 
        software development class in both Java and C, I was immediately hooked and enjoyed 
        the thrill and opportunity of seeing code that I implemented 
        actually working.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, my passion for tech has become more of how I can harness and shape my skills 
        in order to be able to take a product from idea to completion. My goal is to be able 
        to contribute to my society through building impactful/meaningful products that 
        positively impact my community.

      <h1> AWFE (A-Walk-For-Education)</h1>
      <p>
        One of my proudest moments has been organizing the walk for education in both 2018 
        and 2019 as the Academic Excellence Chair of NSBE McGill.This walk is part of an 
        international effort by NSBE to reach out to visible minority students who are 
        passionate about education and have shown keen interest in the STEM field.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over 20 volunteers walk with the kids within the Montreal area. During the walk, 
        the volunteers and community centers get an opportunity to present and explain 
        educational services available for the students. The walk culminates at Les Scientifines 
        where McGill clubs and design teams exhibit their projects alongside those of the 
        different student groups from the community centres. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The students all get an opportunity to solve simple hands-on challenges and for both 
        years 2018 and 2019 I was able to introduce the students to Scratch programming 
        software which they always love. Through this event the team and I have been 
        able to speak to and encourage the students to strive for excellence in school.

        <h2>Block Breaker</h2>
        <p>
          Built a scalable block breaker game using the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern 
          with features to design, play, and compete in a game for entry in the hall of fame. 
        </p>
        <h2>E-Patient</h2>
        <p>
          Built a Web App (E-patient) to improve both staff and patient experience in hearing 
          clinics. This app involved a client/patient facing side and an admin and patient 
          hearing health care provider side.
