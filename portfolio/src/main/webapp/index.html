    <p>I am Edem (/ɛd-ɛm/) Koshi Nuviadenu. I am currently a 3rd year Computer Engineering
      student in McGill University, Canada but my home country is Ghana. I am passionate about
      technology and love learning new skills, especially if it means I get to build impactful
      products. I like to see the opportunity in every challenge because I am a strong believer
      in focusing on goals and not obstacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      My passion for tech really came to light from my love and desire to understand and build
      circuit boards. My interest in software dev grew from my initial implementation of art
      designs using turtle command in python prior to me starting university but I never really
      understood the complexity of what I did until my journey to
      Canada to study Electrical Engineering.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began my university studies at McGill University in 2017. After taking my first
      software development class in both Java and C, I was immediately hooked and enjoyed
      the thrill and opportunity of seeing code that I implemented
      actually working.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, my passion for tech has become more of how I can harness and shape my skills
      in order to be able to take a product from idea to completion. My goal is to be able
      to contribute to my society through building impactful/meaningful products that
      positively impact my community.

    <h1> AWFE (A-Walk-For-Education)</h1>
    <p>
      One of my proudest moments has been organizing the walk for education in both 2018
      and 2019 as the Academic Excellence Chair of NSBE McGill. This walk is part of an
      international effort by NSBE to reach out to visible minority students who are
      passionate about education and have shown keen interest in the STEM field.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over 20 volunteers walk with the kids within the Montreal area. During the walk,
      the volunteers and community centers get an opportunity to present and explain
      educational services available for the students. The walk culminates at Les Scientifines
      where McGill clubs and design teams exhibit their projects alongside those of the
      different student groups from the community centres.
    </p>
    <p>
      The students all get an opportunity to solve simple hands-on challenges and for both
      years 2018 and 2019 I was able to introduce the students to Scratch programming
      software which they always love. Through this event the team and I have been
      able to speak to and encourage the students to strive for excellence in school.

      <h2>Block Breaker</h2>
      <p>
        Built a scalable block breaker game using the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern
        with features to design, play, and compete in a game for entry in the hall of fame.

      <h2>E-Patient</h2>
      <p>
        Built a Web App (E-patient) to improve both staff and patient experience in hearing
        clinics. This app involved a client/patient facing side and an admin and patient
        hearing health care provider side.
